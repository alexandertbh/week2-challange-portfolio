        <!--TODO create about me-->
        <p>
          Born and raised in Seattle I went to Central Washington University
          where I got my Bachelor's in Human Resource Management. I then started
          my career in recruiting where I recruited for accounting, sales,
          finance, and software engineering talent. Now I am looking to make a
          switch into a more technical role by learning coding.

            <h2>Project 1:</h2>
            <p>
              This is my first project for the coding bootcamp where I took the
              code that used basic div and class sections and refactored the
              code to add semantic classes in the HTML as well as reducing
              redundant CSS code.

              This was a game made by using Javascript in order to randomize the
              computer's responses and take the user's input to see who wins.

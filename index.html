                <!--TODO create about me-->
                <p>Born and raised in Seattle I went to Central Washington University where I got my Bachelor's in Human Resource Management. I then started my career in recruiting where I recruited for accounting, sales, finance, and software engineering talent. Now I am looking to make a switch into a more technical role by learning coding. </p>

                <h2>Project 1: </h2>
                <p>This is my first project for the coding bootcamp where I took the code that used basic div and class sections and refactored the code to add semantic classes in the HTML as well as reducing redundant CSS code. </p>

# week2-challange-portfolio

## Description

For our week 2 homework assignment we were challenged to create a portfolio using the HTML and CSS that we learned in week 1. This was an opportunity for us to show our use of flex-boxes for formating as well as dynamic CSS variables for color design and html links to our projects.

## Credits

W3 schools provided supplemental material to refine my understaning of flexboxes as well as other CSS design elements. Then our course material provided the primary reference material.
